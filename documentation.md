# How to use the software #
First of all macros should be enabled to use the software. When the pomodoro excel timer worksheet is open you can see three separate worksheets at the bottom named "Timer", "Activity Inventory", and "Pomodoro Record". The Timer-sheet is what you will work with most of the time. It includes a simple timer, a list containing activities you want to do today and a list where you can put unplanned and urgent tasks. All lists have three columns. The first one is used to describe the activity, the second one holds the number of estimated pomodoros fo this activity, and the third one holds the actual number of pomodoros you spent on this activity.
To start working with the pomodoro excel timer first of all you have to insert some activities in the Activity Inventory. To insert an activity into the to do today just select a arbitrary cell in a row containing the activity you want to move to the to do today list and press the add button.
To start a pomodoro select a cell in a row of the to do today list or the unplanned and urgent tasks list and click the start button. The program then will recognize what activity you are doing at the moment. When the timer ends a message is displayed where you can decide if you want to delete this activity from the to do today list and move it to the Pomodoro Record worksheet or if you want to keep it in the todo today list.

Please note that the software is not very mature yet. There are many functions that have to be improved in the future.
